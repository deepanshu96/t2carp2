# Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project we utilize an Unscented kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. RMSE values are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric.
